✨ Nutrition Companion A lightweight, pure Python command-line application designed to track health metrics and food intake.Philosophy: This project is built entirely from scratch without importing any external libraries or standard Python modules (like math, datetime, or pandas). All logic—including input validation, sorting, and mathematical calculations—is implemented manually.📋 FeaturesUser Profile System: Input and store personal stats (Height, Weight, Age, Gender).Health Calculator: * BMI (Body Mass Index): Calculates score and categorizes (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate): Uses the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation to determine base calorie burn.TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure): Calculates maintenance calories based on activity level.Food Logger: Track food items, calories, and protein grams.Manual Input Validation: A custom is_number function checks for valid floating-point inputs without using try/except blocks.Algorithmic Sorting: Implements a Bubble Sort algorithm manually to organize log entries.🚀 How to RunEnsure you have Python installed on your machine.Save the code in a file named nutrition.py.Open your terminal or command prompt.Navigate to the folder containing the file.Run the following command:Bashpython nutrition.py
> Note: There is a small typo in the very last line of your script (__main____). Please change it to if __name__ == "__main__": (with two underscores on each side) for the script to execute automatically.🧮 The Math Behind the Code1. Body Mass Index (BMI)$$BMI = \frac{Weight(kg)}{Height(m)^2}$$2. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)The program uses the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:Men: $(10 \times weight) + (6.25 \times height) - (5 \times age) + 5$Women: $(10 \times weight) + (6.25 \times height) - (5 \times age) - 161$3. Activity MultipliersYour BMR is multiplied by one of the following factors to find your TDEE:Sedentary: 1.2Lightly Active: 1.375Moderately Active: 1.55Very Active: 1.725Extra Active: 1.9⚠️ LimitationsData Persistence: Since this is a "No Imports" version (no file I/O libraries used), all data is lost when you exit the program.Dates: The current session date is hardcoded to "Current Session" as the datetime module is not used.🛠️ Code Structureis_number(text): Manually iterates through strings to validate if input is a valid float.update_profile(): Collects user demographics.calculate_metrics(): Performs the math for BMI and Calorie goals.view_log(): Displays food history using a manual sorting algorithm.main(): The central loop controlling the menu interface.
